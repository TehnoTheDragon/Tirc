# BASM
I want create cross platform and cross architecture "assembler". I want make this project open source, so anyone who need such tools to build their compilers can just use `basm` for their projects.
> Personally I want use it in my project `box` to create my language works on many different architectures and platforms.  
> I wanted just create a game, and now I am on way when I need to create a tool to create my own programming language
